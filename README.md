2 files contain raw data:
Postdiapausesurv are survival data at end of diapause in each winter climate
Postdiapausesurvall are survival data that considers survival at the date of the final data collection in coldest climate

AggregatedatabySE.txt shows analysis os survival by climate and cold shock-temperature.
It includes functions for aggeregating data using the gplots package.
The code file contains all potential analyses.

All data analyses performed in R Development Core Team 3.3.1
